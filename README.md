# 2DES Meet in the Middle Attack

The goal of this project is to perform a 2DES meet-in-the-middle attack given a ciphertext and corresponding plaintext.  This is considered a known plaintext attack, which is an attack model where the attacker has access to both the plaintext and its encrypted version.  This project demonstrates a known plaintext attack on the 2DES, or double DES, encryption scheme.
